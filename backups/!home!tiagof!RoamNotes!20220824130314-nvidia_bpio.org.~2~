* TODO script to read all sensors in board
    Philip suspects some device temperature drift is affecting
    capacitance of lanes. A variation of more than 5% ~ 10% can cause a
    capacitance drift around 20%.
    The script should scan around time of failure of a lane and collect info
    from all sensors on board. Then report its temperature drift

    Ideas for script:
    - [X] Use a method faster than scan all log file to find the data (using
      splitting the log in two x times until narrow down search by timestamp)
    - [ ] Scan a serdes_analysis report and check for bad lanes. Get first and
      last times where UE/CE occured, then parse the lane info info to generate
      a default data structure for some scripts I did during the Nvidia crysis.
