* Requisites:
    - Nginx
    - setup nginx config file
    - python Flask
    - python flask cors (pip install -U flask-cors)
* Idea:
    Serve static using nginx and use python Flask server which nginx can proxy to proccess server and scripts requests

*** DONE Trigger "Add measure" event when clicking the button
        Observation: change the filter order: instead of measure -> device -> rcb ->
        type NOW IS measure -> board type -> rcb -> device
        - Available measures: check sql dir and list using filenames
*** DONE Trigger events using each dropdown selection
*** DONE Query data using filters
*** DONE Plot data using plotly JS
*** DONE Clean cookies on reload
*** DONE Verify delete traces feature
*** DONE Extend features to Pressure database
*** DONE Verify the ET3activity special case.
        Maybe add a button to get activity?
*** DONE Fix nginx config file.
        The nginx config file needs a few more statements to handle downloads
        It should be like this [[id:d0bf0f31-1f67-422b-aaeb-43e422d68916][hcu-nginx.conf]]
*** DONE set debug to false
*** DONE Develop installation script
        It would be great to have a auto install script for it
        - [X] Setup nginx file
        - [X] Check for file tree integrity (mostly dir public/files)
          Not really needed since files come from perforce
        - [X] Setup server on container

        Hi, Tiago,

        Things are looking good so far.  I have tried launching Dashboard locally (172.17.0.2) and remotely by port-forwarding (mfg-smd12:8080); both work well.

        Before there are more data for me to experiment further with Telegraph, I have a couple thought for you to consider on Dashboard.

        It is a bit plain for the home page.  For some lower hanging fruits, I am thinking we may add at least one or two ?status? information on the page above:

        a.	The livened of SQL database, such as ?Database : active? with active in green and red if inactive for example.  This can be obtained by ?systemctl status mysqld?.

        b.	The available space for data.  The information ?estimation of disk space remaining: 3340 days? retuned by ?xeDiags MANAGEHCU status?.  Note that this is done by ?/Cadence/emulator/hcu/test_suit.py? from container locally (or /et3mach/bin/python/hcu/test_suit.py on SMD).

        Something similar to this (pardon me for my ugly drawing):
