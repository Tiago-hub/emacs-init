* Briefing
    Folks,
 
    Although we will not upgrade rack-side SW for 405, there are a few exercises
    requests to conduct.

    The following are the new HW being added at this moment

    JSJ2242F0037 - 9FAI000328 (SD new substrate and new LPDDR) – Placed in LD 135
    JSJ2242F0036 - 9FAI000328 (SD new substrate and new LPDDR) – Placed in LD 136
    JSJ2242F0038 - 9FAI000325 (SU new substrate) – Placed in LD 114
    JSJ2243F0002 - 9FAI000325 (SU new substrate) - on pe-ld10 will be available EOD
    tomorrow (10/21) – Waiting for Gordon to finish regression on it. 1-2 days

    Tiago: Similar to item#1, can you help exercise these LD board the same way
    once Bruno done?  (If the voltage does not survive power-cycle, please take the
    steps from Bruno and make it part of the exercise).  Once we are done with all
    these exercises, leave the voltage setting active so they can be soaked by
    other people’s job running.
