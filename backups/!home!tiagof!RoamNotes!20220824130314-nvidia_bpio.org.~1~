* TODO script to read all sensors in board
    Philip suspects some device temperature drift is affecting
    capacitance of lanes. A variation of more than 5% ~ 10% can cause a
    capacitance drift around 20%.
    The script should scan around time of failure of a lane and collect info
    from all sensors on board. Then report its temperature drift
