#+title: wxe_install

The wxe install webpage aims to be a user friendly web page that can install a
wxe release.

* Features
 - Select the wxe release
   - Need to read availalble releases from file structure
 - Access tc reports
   - Need to store them somewhere, also parse it. Maybe post it to wiki and them
     redirect it?
 - Python backend using Flask

* To be defined
 - [ ] Will be local or hosted in one smd
   - [ ] Which smd in that case?
 - [ ] Will have some user control?

* Development
** TODO -> get list of all emulators
    - [X] Install nmap into host machine
    - [X] Discover the available smds in networks
      For that used nmap to scan every ip from 10.206.144.0 to 10.206.144.255
      using the following command:
      nmap -sn 10.206.144.0/24 | grep "smd"

      #+begin_src shell
        nmap -sn 10.206.144.0/24 | grep "smd" 
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd401.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.5)   |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd403.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.8)   |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd404.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.9)   |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd405.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.19)  |

      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd30.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.68)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd406.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.78)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd407.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.79)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd28.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.86)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd29.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.87)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | pe-smd17.cadence.com    | (10.206.144.97)  |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd408.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.123) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd409.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.124) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd32.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.134) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd411a.cadence.com | (10.206.144.138) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd411b.cadence.com | (10.206.144.139) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd413.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.164) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd414.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.165) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd415.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.166) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd416.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.167) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd412.cadence.com  | (10.206.144.176) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | te-smd1.cadence.com     | (10.206.144.182) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | mfg-smd1.cadence.com    | (10.206.144.194) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | mfg-smd2.cadence.com    | (10.206.144.195) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | hsv-smd22.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.230) |
      | Nmap | scan | report | for | mfg-smd12.cadence.com   | (10.206.144.248) |

      Then I can use awk and cut to extract just the hostname of the smds

      #+begin_src shell
        nmap -sn 10.206.144.0/24 | grep "smd" | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d '.' -f1
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:
      | hsv-smd401  |
      | hsv-smd403  |
      | hsv-smd404  |
      | hsv-smd405  |
      | hsv-smd26   |
      | hsv-smd27   |
      | hsv-smd30   |
      | hsv-smd406  |
      | hsv-smd407  |
      | hsv-smd28   |
      | hsv-smd29   |
      | pe-smd17    |
      | hsv-smd408  |
      | hsv-smd409  |
      | hsv-smd32   |
      | hsv-smd411a |
      | hsv-smd411b |
      | hsv-smd413  |
      | hsv-smd414  |
      | hsv-smd415  |
      | hsv-smd416  |
      | hsv-smd412  |
      | te-smd1     |
      | mfg-smd1    |
      | mfg-smd2    |
      | hsv-smd22   |
      | mfg-smd12   |

      Finally using sed this ouptut can be formated to json and saved to file
      
      sed 's/^/"/;1s/^/[/;1s/^/{"emulators":/;s/$/"/;$!s/$/,/;$s/$/]/;$s/$/}/'
    - [X] Create script to auto run the nmap, filter output and save to file
      with smd names
    - [X] Read this file into server to list for user the available emulators
    - [ ] Define a cronjob to update the smd files 
* TODO -> get list of all ibhosts
    Can go straightforward with same idea for emulators, but using 158.140.43.0/24
    ip pattern. Need to check with Chris how to procede because there is a lot of
    machines and don't know if like we can use everything.
    For now I'm going to just write the json by hand
    #+begin_src shell
      nmap -sn 158.140.43.0/24 | grep "\-sc"
    #+end_src

* TODO -> get list of branches
    - [ ] For now hardcoded to be 21h1, 22h1, main. Check with Chris/Bruno if there is
    some place to get those info
* DONE -> get list of available versions
    - [X] Need to remove entries like xeDiags, etc

* TODO -> run install script
    - [ ] Create dir to host the source code
    - [ ] Check if dir is empty. If empty, clone repo
    - [ ] Check with fetch if there is any change to pull
    - [ ] Pull changes
    - [ ] Run script passing given parameters
