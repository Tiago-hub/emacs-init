*** DONE Trigger "Add measure" event when clicking the button
        Observation: change the filter order: instead of measure -> device -> rcb ->
        type NOW IS measure -> board type -> rcb -> device
        - Available measures: check sql dir and list using filenames
*** DONE Trigger events using each dropdown selection
*** DONE Query data using filters
*** DONE Plot data using plotly JS
*** DONE Clean cookies on reload
*** DONE Verify delete traces feature
*** DONE Extend features to Pressure database
*** DONE Verify the ET3activity special case.
        Maybe add a button to get activity?
*** DONE Fix nginx config file.
        The nginx config file needs a few more statements to handle downloads
        It should be like this [[id:d0bf0f31-1f67-422b-aaeb-43e422d68916][hcu-nginx.conf]]
*** DONE set debug to false
*** DONE Develop installation script
        It would be great to have a auto install script for it
        - [X] Setup nginx file
        - [X] Check for file tree integrity (mostly dir public/files)
          Not really needed since files come from perforce
        - [X] Setup server on container
